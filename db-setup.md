Want to
* Import a `properly structured` json object into a table in a `relational database`
* Import json data into a `collection` in a `no-sql database`
* Define or create schema as a grunt-task

This task helps you in achieving the above.

It uses knex and lodash as dependencies.
* lodash to read the json in recursion
* knex as the ORM
  * to write into a db provided in the config
  * to define new schema
